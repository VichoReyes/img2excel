This is a copy of [this service](https://www.think-maths.co.uk/spreadsheet) because I thought it was cool, and it
stopped working.

What it does is make an Excel file from an image, with the cells set to the numbers of each channel in each pixel of
the image.

Then it adds conditional formatting to each row, going from black to either red, green or blue depending on the row.
This way, the Excel file basically renders as an image.

You can try it out [here](https://img2excel.vichoreyes.cl/).
